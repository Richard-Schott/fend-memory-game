## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## Contributing

This repository is the starter code for _all_ Udacity students. Therefore, we most likely will not accept pull requests.

## Comments
1. My first event, a click function, needs to have a variable to define the cards. I approached this backwards, using the document to toggle .card.
2. Use an event parameter to target, otherwise he inner function targets all cards when the toggle is applied.

## Acknowledgements
First, I'd like to thank Sachin, Judi Portwood, Lou, and drunkenkismet from the FEND Slack for their help.
